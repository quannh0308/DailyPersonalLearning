# DMA
## Introduction
The `Digital Markets Act` (DMA) is a new European regulation which “intends to ensure a higher degree of competition[...] by preventing large companies from abusing their market power”. 

"Big Tech" (Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Apple, Microsoft) are likely to be the main subjects of the act, but not the only ones. Companies identified as gatekeepers under the DMA have until 6 March 2024 to comply with all of the Act's provisions.

The Commission aims to guarantee a fair level of competition ("level playing field") on the highly concentrated digital European markets, which are often characterised by a "winner takes all" configuration. DMA introduces multiple regulations those the `Gatekeepers` need to follow to be compliant.

The DMA covers eight different sectors, which it refers to as Core Platforms Services (CPS). Due to the presence of gatekeepers who, to a certain degree, affect the market contestability, the CPS are considered problematic by the European Commission:
- online search engines (e.g. Google Search);
- online intermediation services (e.g. Google Play Store, Apple's App Store);
- social networks (e.g. Facebook);
- video sharing platforms (e.g. YouTube);
- communication platforms (e.g. WhatsApp, Gmail);
- advertising services (e.g. Google Ads);
- operating systems (e.g. Android, iOS);
- cloud services (e.g. Amazon Web Services).

**Ultimate goal:** DMA aims at preventing large companies from abusing their market power and to allow smaller and new players to enter the market.

## Compliant rules - do and don't
### Do(s)
- Allow third parties to inter-operate with the gatekeeper’s own services in certain specific situations.
    - E.g. Allow third-party application to send-message-to/receive-message-from Whatapps.
- Allow their business users to access the data that they generate in their use of the gatekeeper’s platform.
    - This is similar like what GDPR is about.
- Provide companies advertising on their platform with the tools and information necessary for advertisers and publishers to carry out their own independent verification of their advertisements hosted by the gatekeeper.
    - E.g. Without customer consent, company cannot use customer information cross platform. E.g. if we consider Thread another platform than Facebook, and Meta want to do Facebook ads to customer using Thread, they need to ask customer first.
- Allow their business users to promote their offer and conclude contracts with their customers outside the gatekeeper’s platform

### Don't(s)
- Treat services and products offered by the gatekeeper itself more favourably in ranking than similar services or products offered by third parties on the gatekeeper's platform.
    - E.g. In Google Search, Google couldn't favor Youtube than other platform if they produces the same ranks.
- Prevent consumers from linking up to businesses outside their platforms.
- Prevent users from un-installing any pre-installed software or app if they wish so
    - E.g. iOS starts allowing customers to uninstall applications like iMessage, Map.
- Track end users outside of the gatekeepers' core platform service for the purpose of targeted advertising, without effective consent having been granted
    - E.g. Without customer consent, company cannot use customer information cross platform. E.g. if we consider Thread another platform than Facebook, and Meta want to do Facebook ads to customer using Thread, they need to ask customer first.
