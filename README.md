# Introduction
This package demonstrates my attempt to learn something new everyday. `Something` could be as small as a Leetcode problem, to bigger as DSA, or a technical design, a system design and marketplace problem/compliance rules

# Project structure
Project contains different packages from `small` to `big`:
- `leetcode`: Barely leetcode problems. It should follow structure: Problem - my solution - the solution. Sometimes, try to solve 1 leetcode problem if being bored.
- `dsa`: This is similar to `leetcode`. However, it is more likely to be copied from www.geeksforgeeks.org. I expect to learn more from practicing this than adding `leetcode` problem.
- `systemdesign`: Contain small technical design or bigger system design. I expect this to sharpen my designing skills and learn Cloud services in order to convert from theorical system design to be the real design. Some sources to add:
    - Github: https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer
    - Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexxubyte/ and more.
    - Books: Domain-Driven Design by Eric Evans. [reference](https://www.google.de/books/edition/Domain_Driven_Design/hHBf4YxMnWMC?hl=en&gbpv=1&printsec=frontcover)
    - https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DomainDrivenDesign.html
    - And more
- `technology`: Pure technology. I expect to learn new technology ot review my already-learned technologies. Some sources:
    - AWS blogs: I expect to learn some technologies, as like how CloudSearch works.
    - Review Storage technologies: https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Database-Internals-Deep-Distributed-Systems/dp/1492040347
    - Learn from other companies as Alphabet, Meta, Netfix, Snowflake, DataBricks, etc.
- `marketplacecompliance`: This is more than just technology. It is the rules in which authorities set to control the technology sectors. These specifically focus on Europe rules, as we usually see EU puts copmliance rules over company to protect customer data and also small businesses.

# Personal goal
Spend at least 30 minutes daily to finish writing down one problem.

# Log (also identical to git log)
See the logs. If the day is in future, it means my expected plan to add.
